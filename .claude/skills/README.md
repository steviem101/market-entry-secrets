# MES Claude Code Skills Library

Reviewed operating knowledge for working on Market Entry Secrets (MES-113). These skills exist so
that **any** Claude model (especially Opus) delivers MES work — research, reports, content, data,
code — at the same quality and safety level, without re-learning conventions each session.

**Read-first order** (before your first MES task, read at least 1–3):

1. `mes-codebase-conventions` — repo map, stack rules, verified conventions. Always read first.
2. `supabase-rls-and-migrations` — before touching schema, policies, or any migration.
3. `secrets-and-env-management` — before touching env vars, keys, or anything credential-shaped.
4. `freemium-tier-gating` — before touching gated content, tiers, or conversion surfaces.
5. `stripe-payments-and-webhooks` — before touching checkout, webhooks, or entitlements.
6. `report-generation-quality` — before touching the report pipeline or writing report content.
7. `edge-functions-and-cost-controls` — before writing/modifying any edge function.
8. `qa-and-exam` — before shipping: grade your output against the baselines and rubric.

## Source-of-truth boundaries

One skill owns each cross-cutting topic; others must **link, not restate**:

- Entitlement invariants → `stripe-payments-and-webhooks`
- Secret handling → `secrets-and-env-management`
- Anti-hallucination / grounding → `report-generation-quality`
- Logging / cost attribution → `observability-logging-and-cost-attribution` (Wave 2; interim
  operational rules live in `edge-functions-and-cost-controls`)

## Keeping the library honest

- Every skill has a `Last verified:` date and an Evidence section citing real files/tables.
  If the repo or schema has changed materially since that date, re-verify before trusting a rule.
- Found a gap, a wrong rule, or a contradiction? Log it in `.claude/skills/CHANGELOG.md` (or the
  PR description) so it gets fixed in a follow-up PR. A single wrong rule erodes the whole library.
- Notion sources of truth: [MES Ticket Writing Context](https://app.notion.com/p/95be3b3db0d3427295fba8664011d7ad)
  (ticket structure, risk flags, status workflow). Skills encode operational rules only — link,
  don't duplicate.
