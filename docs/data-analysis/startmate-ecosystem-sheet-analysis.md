# Startmate Community-Sourced Ecosystem Sheet — Analysis & Safe Ingestion Plan

**Date:** 2026-07-03
**Source:** [Startmate community sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lIK2Lji83-tO5DlgMHu7KI7WeVzPqL9fFJ2hrNuVaCg) (7 tabs: VCs, Accelerators, Startup Newsletters, Coworking Spaces, Student Societies, Workshop Hosts, Podcasts)
**Status:** Phase 1 — analysis only. **No production writes, no migrations applied.** Everything below the mapping matrix is a proposal awaiting admin approval.
**Tooling:** `scripts/parse_startmate_sheet.py` (dry-run parser/profiler; `--self-test` covers the normalization helpers). Raw sheet + parsed JSON live under the gitignored `data/private/startmate/` path (HYG-02: the sheet contains personal emails and LinkedIn URLs — do not commit).

## 1. Sheet overview

Profiled from the 2026-07-03 xlsx export (896 usable data rows total). The sheet is community-sourced and must be treated as **unverified input**.

| Tab | Data rows | Key columns | Notable quality issues |
|---|---:|---|---|
| VCs | 219 | Full Name, Fund, LinkedIn, Job Title, City, Country, Sector Focus | 13 missing LinkedIn, 1 LinkedIn *search* placeholder, 15 unknown geography, 29 missing fund, 65 missing job title, 85 missing city; sector focus filled on only 78 rows |
| Accelerators | 90 | Status, Name, Point of Contact, City/Country, Investment, Cohort Timing, Focus, Association, Website | 19 marked **Inactive**, 3 CVC; 22 missing website; location free-text ("Naarm/Melbourne/Australia", "Lower Hunter, Central Coast / Australia"); sidebar noise columns (K/L) |
| Startup Newsletters | 48 | Name, Country, Contact, Focus, Subscribe link | Links hidden behind "Link" display text (extracted via xlsx hyperlink targets); 2 missing links; 3 links are LinkedIn newsletters; 3 Fullstack newsletters share one domain |
| Coworking Spaces | 49 | Name, Country, City, Suburb, Contact, $/Desk, Focus, Website | 4 missing website; cost filled on only 13 rows; multi-campus chains (Stone & Chalk ×3, Tank Stream Labs ×6, Spacecubed brands ×3, cirque ×2) |
| Student Societies | 477 | Active, Name, University, Contact, Role, Email, Website | Very thin: 242 Facebook-only links, 212 no link at all, 18 emails, 17 named contacts; only 22 rows marked Active; broken header row (a university name occupies a header cell); ~416 rows are general-interest clubs (maths, esports, anime), not startup societies |
| Workshop Hosts | 11 | Submitter, Topic, Host Name, LinkedIn, Email, Attended?, Comments | Personal emails throughout; two header rows; 1 duplicate host (May Samali ×2); topics are personal development / coaching, not market entry |
| Podcasts | 2 | Name, Country, Contact, Focus, Link | Only 2 rows |

**Intra-sheet duplicates found (17 dedupe-key collisions):** May Samali (Workshop Hosts, genuine duplicate), ANU Mathematics Society + Impact Consulting Group (Societies, genuine duplicates), and domain-level groupings that are *campuses/brands of one org*, not errors: Stone & Chalk (3 campuses), Tank Stream Labs (6 hubs), Spacecubed brands (FLUX/Fern/Riff), CreativeCubes.Co (2), cirque (2), WorkLife (2), CORE Innovation Hub (2), I2N (3 accelerator streams + 1 newsletter), UTS programs (2), Fullstack newsletters (3, one domain).

## 2. MES relevance assessment

Cross-checked (read-only) against live MES production data on 2026-07-03: `investors` 447 rows (267 angel / 145 vc / 20 grant / 12 venture_debt / 3 accelerator), `innovation_ecosystem` 124, `community_members` 134, `service_providers` 95, `content_items` 141, `events` 192.

### High value

1. **VCs tab (219 people across 117 distinct funds)** — the strongest asset. Overlap with `investors` (verified audit in §4.5):
   - **Fund level:** **53 of 117 funds already exist** (51 exact/normalized-name matches plus 2 alias duplicates only caught by manual review: Artesian→"Artesian Capital Management", OneVentures→"1V (OneVentures)"); 2 more are probable aliases of "NZ Growth Capital Partners" (NZGCP, Aspire); 1 row is junk ("At" — a truncated entry). **61 funds are genuinely new** (≈30 AU/NZ — e.g. XV Capital, GD1, MOVAC, Icehouse Ventures, Kilara Capital, 1835i, Potentia, Reinventure, Tenmile, Outset; ≈31 US/global funds noted as ANZ-active — Base10, Battery, Lightspeed, Peak XV, M12…).
   - **Person level:** 18 of 219 people are already `investors` rows (17 verified by matching LinkedIn profile slugs — including "Ed Hooper"→"Edward Hooper", which name matching alone misses). The bigger win is **contact enrichment of existing fund rows**: today `investors` has `contact_name` NULL on 446/447 rows, `linkedin_url` NULL on 207, `website` NULL on 197. The sheet provides named partners with real LinkedIn profile URLs (205 of 219) and job titles for the biggest AU funds (Blackbird ×11, Main Sequence ×7, Square Peg ×7, AirTree ×7…).
   - PII note: `investors_public` deliberately excludes `contact_email`/`contact_name`/`linkedin_url`, so person data lands admin/member-side only — no public exposure change.
2. **Accelerators (90; 67 Active)** — maps to `innovation_ecosystem` (which already models accelerators: 53 rows carry the `Accelerator` service tag). The verified audit (§4.5) found **42 of 90 already on the platform or run by an org that is** — far more than name matching alone suggested, because domain + program/parent matching catches renames and umbrella orgs (Cicada→Cicada Innovations, SVG|THRIVE→THRIVE APAC Accelerator, iLab UQ→ilab, Genesis→Sydney Genesis Program, Fishburners Women's Accelerator→Fishburners, CSIRO ON Accelerate→On Accelerate…). Net: **≈32 Active accelerators are genuinely new** (Farmers2Founders, HATCH Taronga, Boab, LuminaX*, Ocean Impact Organisation, The Factory NZ, Creative HQ, Whakatipu Incubator, Kokiri, UTS Techcelerator, Founders Bio/Climate/Defence 10x, Australian Clinical Entrepreneur Program…), with program metadata MES lacks today: investment amount, cohort timing, sector focus, backing fund. (*LuminaX needs a manual check — it shares a domain with investors."LX Health".)
3. **Coworking Spaces (49 rows ≈ 40 orgs)** — maps to `innovation_ecosystem` (`Co-working` service tag: 23 rows today). Verified audit: **9 of 49 rows belong to orgs already on the platform** (all four Stone & Chalk campuses, Fishburners, Harbour City Labs, EnergyLab, I2N Hub Honeysuckle, CHICC→ANDHealth+), leaving **≈33 new orgs** after campus grouping. City/suburb granularity (Sydney 18, Melbourne 10, Perth 5, plus regional: Newcastle, Wollongong, Byron Bay, Newman, Shoalhaven) directly supports location pages and the "landing infrastructure" story in reports.
4. **Startup Newsletters (48)** — not directory material, but excellent **ecosystem-monitoring and report-grounding source material**: 47/48 ANZ-focused with working subscribe links, spanning sector niches (What the Health, Funding Climatetech, Talking HealthTech, Fintechfun) and institutional sources (LaunchVic, NZGCP Aspire, CSIRO ON). Best first landing: one curated `content_items` guide (+ KB chunks via the existing content pipeline), not a new table.

### Medium value

5. **Podcasts (2 rows)** — same treatment as newsletters; too few for anything structural. Fold into the same curated guide.

### Low value / recommended exclusions (phase 1)

6. **Student Societies (477)** — weakest fit for a B2B market-entry audience: 87% fail a startup-relevance keyword filter (maths/esports/anime/cultural clubs), 45% have no URL, 51% Facebook-only, contacts are students who churn annually. **Exclude from directories.** Optional later: a single KB/content summary of the ~60 entrepreneurship-focused societies (UNSW Founders, UTS Startups, Melbourne Bioinnovation, StartupLink Unimelb…) as university-channel intelligence.
7. **Workshop Hosts (11)** — personal-development coaches with personal emails; not market-entry mentors (MES archetypes: Trade & Government, International Founder, Active Advisor, Scaled Founder). **Exclude from auto-import.** If any are wanted later, route them through the existing `directory_submissions` mentor funnel one at a time.

## 3. Destination mapping matrix

| Sheet entity | Rows in scope | Destination | Field mapping | Missing/derived fields | Confidence |
|---|---:|---|---|---|---|
| VC **funds** (new, AU/NZ) | ≈30 | `investors` (new rows, `investor_type='vc'`) | name←Fund; sector_focus[]←Sector Focus (split/normalized); location←City; country←Country; linkedin_url←(company page if present) | description, website, slug — **must be enriched before/at promotion** (existing `enrich-investors` edge fn fills `basic_info`/`why_work_with_us` post-insert); check sizes unknown | High |
| VC **funds** (new, US/global ANZ-active) | ≈31 | `investors` (new rows) — second batch | as above + country='US' | as above; decide whether US funds belong in the directory at all | Medium |
| VC **people** at matched funds | ≈100+ | `investors` **enrichment of existing rows** | contact_name←Full Name (most senior person); linkedin_url←LinkedIn; extra people → `details.contacts` jsonb array `{name, title, linkedin, source}` | nothing new required — columns exist and are mostly NULL | High |
| VC people with no fund / angels | ≈29 | review case-by-case → possible `investors` `investor_type='angel'` rows | name, linkedin_url, location | description; verify they actually invest | Low–Med |
| Accelerators (Active, verified new) | ≈32 | `innovation_ecosystem` | name; website; location←City/Country (normalized); services=['Accelerator'] (+'Seed Funding' when Investment present); sectors/sector_tags←Focus; description←composed from Focus+Investment+Cohort Timing+Association | `description`, `employees`, `founded` are **NOT NULL** — seed with composed description + `employees='Unknown'`, `founded='Unknown'`, then run existing `enrich-innovation-ecosystem` edge fn | High |
| Accelerators (Inactive/CVC) | 22 | **exclude** (`innovation_ecosystem` has no `is_active` flag; importing dead programs pollutes the directory) | — | — | — |
| Coworking spaces (verified new) | ≈33 orgs | `innovation_ecosystem` | name (campus rows merged to one org); website; location←City (+Suburb); services=['Co-working']; description←Focus (+cost when present) | same NOT NULL trio as accelerators; multi-campus orgs keep one row, campuses listed in description/experience_tiles | High |
| Newsletters + Podcasts | 50 | `content_items` — one curated guide ("ANZ startup media & newsletters") with sections per category; KB chunks follow automatically via the content fan-out triggers | title/body composed from Name+Focus+Link, grouped by sector | none — fits existing content pipeline; no schema change | High |
| Student societies | 477 | **exclude** phase 1 (optional later: KB summary of ~60 startup societies) | — | — | — |
| Workshop hosts | 11 | **exclude** (manual `directory_submissions` if ever wanted) | — | — | — |

**Assumptions to validate with Stephen:** (a) US funds are wanted in the investor directory (they're gated `member`-visibility in KB anyway); (b) one org row per multi-campus coworking chain; (c) partner names/LinkedIn on fund rows is acceptable — they stay out of `investors_public` by construction.

## 4. Data quality report (validation output)

From `scripts/parse_startmate_sheet.py` against the 2026-07-03 snapshot:

- **Missing websites:** Accelerators 22 (mostly Inactive rows), Coworking 4, Newsletters 2, Societies 212.
- **Placeholder/search links:** 1 LinkedIn search-results URL (VCs), treated as missing → low confidence.
- **Social-only links:** 242 Facebook/Instagram (nearly all Societies), 1 Accelerator.
- **Invalid emails:** 1 (Societies). Workshop-host emails are personal → PII, kept out of the repo.
- **Geography:** VCs 141 AU / 20 NZ / 43 US / 15 unknown; Accelerators 83 ANZ-classifiable; Coworking 48 ANZ; Newsletters 47 ANZ. Unknowns default to low confidence, never dropped silently.
- **Normalization needed:** fund-name variants (AirTree/AirTree Ventures, SquarePeg/Square Peg), location free-text ("Naarm/Melbourne/Australia"), sector focus is comma-separated free text needing mapping onto MES `sector_tags` vocabulary.
- **Confidence distribution (all tabs):** high 317 / medium 47 / low 532 (societies dominate low).

## 4.5 Verified duplicate audit vs live platform data (2026-07-03)

Full cross-table sweep of every sheet candidate against `investors` (447), `innovation_ecosystem` (124), `service_providers` (95), `community_members` (134), `trade_investment_agencies` (134) and `content_items` (141), using four match tiers in priority order: **website domain** → **LinkedIn slug** → **normalized name** → **fuzzy name (SequenceMatcher ≥ 0.87, review-only)**. Read-only; no writes.

### VC funds — 53/117 duplicates
- 51 caught automatically by normalized-name matching (incl. AirTree→Airtree Ventures, Blacknova→Black Nova VC, SquarePeg→Square Peg Capital, Sprint+Sprint Ventures→one row, NAB→service_providers."NAB (National Australia Bank)" — a cross-table *related* hit, see rules below).
- 2 caught only by alias review: **Artesian → "Artesian Capital Management"**, **OneVentures → "1V (OneVentures)"**. These prove an alias table is required, not optional.
- 2 probable aliases needing Stephen's call: **NZGCP** and **Aspire (part of NZGCP)** vs existing "NZ Growth Capital Partners".
- 1 junk row: fund "At" (truncated cell; the person row — Will O'Connell, Sydney — is still usable).
- Net new: **61 funds** (≈30 ANZ / ≈31 US-global).

### VC people — 18/219 already on platform
17 verified by LinkedIn-slug equality (the strongest person key; catches "Ed Hooper"→"Edward Hooper") + 1 by name. All 18 become *enrichment* candidates (fill NULL `linkedin_url`/title), never new rows.

### Accelerators — 42/90 duplicate or platform-related
- 35 Active + 7 Inactive rows match existing records. Notable non-obvious catches: Cicada→Cicada Innovations, SVG|THRIVE→THRIVE APAC Accelerator, iLab UQ→ilab, Genesis→Sydney Genesis Program, CSIRO ON Accelerate→On Accelerate, Fishburners Women's Accelerator→Fishburners, Techstars→Techstars Sydney, iAccelerate→iAccelerate Wollongong, RMIT Activator→Activator LaunchHUB, Runway HQ Geelong→Runway HQ, Plus Eight (Spacecubed)→Plus Eight, muruD→muru-D, I2N ×3→I2N Accelerator Program.
- **Known fuzzy false positives (both rejected on review): LaunchAI ≠ "Launch It", Sprout (NZ) ≠ "SproutX" (AU).** This is why the fuzzy tier (0.87–0.98) must always be human-reviewed, never auto-merged.
- **Cross-table relations, not duplicates:** Startmate + 77 Challenge + Melt + LuminaX match `investors` rows (the program's *fund* is on the platform, the *program* may still merit its own `innovation_ecosystem` row) — routed to reviewer as `related_record`, not `duplicate`.
- Net new Active: **≈32 programs**.

### Coworking — 9/49 rows already covered
Stone & Chalk ×4 campuses → existing "Stone & Chalk"; Fishburners; Harbour City Labs; EnergyLab; I2N Hub Honeysuckle → I2N; CHICC → ANDHealth+ (same operator). Net new after campus grouping: **≈33 orgs**.

### Newsletters / Podcasts — 0 duplicates in `content_items`
6 newsletters are published by orgs already on the platform (Startmate, Main Sequence's Deeptech MSV, Emily Casey's What the Health, UNSW Founders, River City Labs, CSIRO ON) — useful as attribution links in the curated guide, not blockers.

### Lessons folded into the dedupe rules (§5.3)
1. **Shared institutional domains must not count as duplicate keys.** 12 accelerator rows sit on university/agency domains (`*.edu.au`, `*.edu`, `*.ac.nz`, `*.gov.au`, `csiro.au`) — e.g. Genesis and USYD Innovation Hub both on `sydney.edu.au` are *different programs*. Domain matches on these TLD groups downgrade to `related_record`.
2. **A cross-table match is a relation, not a duplicate.** Same org can legitimately exist as an investor *and* an ecosystem program (Startmate does today). The candidate carries `matched_existing_id` + `match_note` and the reviewer decides merge vs. coexist.
3. **Maintain a small alias map** seeded with: Artesian↔Artesian Capital Management, OneVentures↔1V (OneVentures), NZGCP↔NZ Growth Capital Partners, AirTree↔Airtree Ventures, Blacknova↔Black Nova VC, muruD↔muru-D.
4. **Fuzzy tier is review-only.** Auto-dedupe only on domain (non-institutional), LinkedIn slug, or normalized-name equality.

## 5. Proposed ingestion architecture (phase 2 — needs approval)

Reuses the repo's proven pattern: *staging table with review statuses* (`trade_agencies_enrichment_staging`, `events_staging` precedents) → manual review gate doc → COALESCE-protected apply → KB sync happens automatically.

### 5.1 One additive staging table

**Implemented as `supabase/migrations/20260703120000_create_ecosystem_import_candidates.sql`** (rollback: `supabase/rollback/20260703120000_create_ecosystem_import_candidates_revert.sql`). Key points beyond the original sketch:

- `proposed_action` column (`insert_new` / `enrich_existing` / `related_review` / `content_guide` / `review` / `exclude`) so the reviewer filters by decision type.
- `verification jsonb` + `verified_at` — each researched candidate carries a web-research verdict `{status, evidence, sources, corrections}` from the pre-staging verification pass (§5.2 step 3).
- `matched_table` / `match_method` alongside `matched_existing_id`, so §4.5's duplicate-vs-related distinction is visible in-row.
- RLS mirrors `report_quality_proposals` exactly: `ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY`, `REVOKE ALL FROM anon, authenticated`, admin SELECT/UPDATE policies via `has_role`, inserts service-role only, **no client grants** (a future admin-UI ticket would add a scoped `GRANT` — stricter than the earlier sketch in this doc, which included one).
- `UNIQUE (batch_id, dedupe_key)` for idempotent re-staging; `source_rows integer[]` because campus-grouped candidates span several sheet rows.


**No existing RLS policy is touched; public read access is not widened anywhere.**

> Migration-hygiene reminder (docs/migrations.md): the main→prod ledger is in `MIGRATIONS_FAILED` drift — a merged migration does **not** auto-apply. The staging DDL ships as a PR'd migration file that a human applies via `supabase db push`; agents must not `apply_migration` against prod.

### 5.2 Pipeline steps (all dry-run-first)

1. **Parse (exists, this PR):** `python3 scripts/parse_startmate_sheet.py` — xlsx → `data/private/startmate/parsed_startmate_ecosystem.json` + PII-free profile on stdout. No DB access, rerunnable.
2. **Match & payload build (exists, this PR):** `scripts/generate_startmate_candidates.py` — joins parsed JSON against a read-only snapshot of `investors` / `innovation_ecosystem` / `service_providers` / `trade_investment_agencies` / `community_members` / `content_items` (snapshot SQL embedded in the script), applies the §4.5 match tiers, assigns `proposed_action`, builds `proposed_payload`, and emits `scripts/startmate_import_blocks/*.sql` INSERT blocks for the staging table only (repo `*_blocks` convention). Dry-run by default; `--write` emits files; `--self-test` covers the matching rules (alias map, institutional-domain guard, cross-table action mapping).
3. **Verification research pass (run 2026-07-03):** community sheets go stale, so every `insert_new`/`related_review`/`content_guide` candidate (186 of 314) was checked by parallel web-research agents (Claude Sonnet-class, ~11 orgs each) before staging: does the org still exist and operate in 2025–2026, correct website/location, one-line factual description, founding year. Verdicts land in `verification` jsonb (`verified/inactive/defunct/not_found/uncertain` + evidence + source URLs); `defunct`/`inactive`/`not_found` flips `proposed_action` to `exclude`; confirmed corrections merge into `proposed_payload`. Results file: `data/private/startmate/verification_results.json` (rerunnable; merged by the generator). LinkedIn is never scraped. `enrich_existing` candidates skip research — their writes are COALESCE-only fills reviewed by an admin anyway.
4. **Stage:** apply the INSERT blocks to `ecosystem_import_candidates` (supervised MCP session or psql by an admin — the trade-agencies Phase-3 precedent). Idempotent via `UNIQUE (batch_id, dedupe_key)` `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`.
5. **Review gate:** a staging-review doc like `docs/trade-agencies-staging-review-2026-05-09.md` — summary stats, confidence distribution, flagged duplicates, 10–15 representative diffs. Admin flips `status` to approved/rejected/duplicate (SQL or, later, an AdminSubmissions-style page — see §5.4).
6. **Apply (approved rows only):** per-destination apply script generating SQL that:
   - **new rows** → plain INSERTs (never upsert-overwrite);
   - **enrichment of matched rows** → `COALESCE(existing, new)` per field — only fills NULLs, mirroring the trade-agencies apply rules; extra fund contacts merge into `investors.details.contacts` with `{source:'startmate_community_sheet', batch_id}` attribution;
   - stamps `applied_at` + `target_record_id` back on the candidate row (provenance ledger).
7. **KB / report grounding:** nothing extra to build. `upsert_kb_investor` / `upsert_kb_ecosystem` triggers sync promoted rows into `mes_knowledge_base` (PII-stripped) and the `embed-knowledge` cron embeds them within minutes. Investor rows are `member`-visibility by design. The newsletters guide flows through the content-chunk fan-out the same way. **Raw unreviewed sheet rows are never embedded.**
8. **Post-promotion enrichment:** run existing admin edge fns `enrich-investors` (`only_missing`) and `enrich-innovation-ecosystem` to backfill descriptions/logos from websites.

### 5.3 Validation & dedupe rules (implemented in the parser; enforced again at apply)

- Normalize URLs (https, lowercase host, strip `www.`/trailing slash); reject non-URLs; prefer xlsx hyperlink targets over display text.
- Dedupe key: **website domain** when real (LinkedIn/Facebook domains don't count) else **normalized org name + geography** (suffixes like Ventures/Capital/Partners/Accelerator stripped). Multi-campus chains collapse to one org candidate; campuses preserved in `raw`.
- Person key: normalized full name + fund.
- Cross-table match: domain equality (excluding shared institutional domains — `*.edu.au`, `*.edu`, `*.ac.nz`, `*.gov.au`, `csiro.au`) → LinkedIn slug → alias map → normalized-name equality → fuzzy (≥0.87, **review-only**, see §4.5 false positives). Same-table matches become *enrichment* candidates, never new rows; cross-table matches are flagged `related_record` for the reviewer.
- LinkedIn search URLs / Google search links ⇒ `placeholder_search_link`, confidence low.
- No website + no LinkedIn + no contact ⇒ confidence low. Inactive accelerators ⇒ excluded. Unknown geography ⇒ flagged, never silently dropped.
- Every candidate carries the verbatim `raw` row, source tab + row number, and batch id.

### 5.4 Admin review workflow

First batch: SQL-based review (as with trade agencies), driven from the review-gate doc. If this becomes recurring, a follow-up ticket can add an `AdminImportCandidates` page cloned from `src/pages/AdminSubmissions.tsx` + `useAdminSubmissions.ts` (the RLS above already permits admin SELECT/UPDATE from the client, so the UI needs no policy changes).

### 5.5 Rollback / disable

- Phase 1 (this PR): delete the branch/doc — nothing touched.
- Staging: `DELETE FROM ecosystem_import_candidates WHERE batch_id = 'startmate-2026-07'`; table drop via a rollback file in `supabase/rollback/` (additive table, nothing depends on it).
- Applied new rows: recorded in `target_record_id` → `DELETE ... WHERE id IN (SELECT target_record_id ...)`; KB rows follow automatically via the delete triggers.
- Applied enrichments: COALESCE-only writes mean originals were NULL; reverting = setting those fields back to NULL for the batch's `target_record_id`s.
- Scripts stay dry-run by default; writes require explicit `--write` flags.

## 6. RLS / security impact assessment

- **No changes to existing policies or grants.** One new table, locked per SEC-02 (anon: nothing; authenticated: admin-policy-gated SELECT/UPDATE only; inserts service-role).
- No service-role key in the client or repo; staging inserts run server-side/local (env vars, per `scripts/seed_ireland_country_page.ts` convention).
- PII containment: sheet emails/LinkedIn stay in `data/private/` (gitignored) and in staging `raw` jsonb (admin-only). On promotion, person data goes only to `investors` base-table columns already excluded from `investors_public`; `kb_strip_pii` scrubs anything that leaks into KB content.
- No paid/free gating changes; investor KB visibility stays `member` as-is.

## 7. Open questions for Stephen

1. Include the ~25 US/global funds in the `investors` directory, or ANZ-only for batch 1?
2. VC partner names+LinkedIn onto fund rows (`contact_name`/`details.contacts`) — comfortable with that as member-gated data?
3. Multi-campus coworking chains: one org row (recommended) or one row per campus?
4. Newsletters guide: publish publicly under `/content`, or keep internal as KB-only grounding first?
5. Any appetite for the ~60 startup-relevant student societies as a single KB intelligence note, or drop the tab entirely?
6. Who applies the staging migration + insert blocks to prod (given the migration-drift freeze)?

## 8. Step-by-step implementation plan (after approval)

1. PR the `ecosystem_import_candidates` migration (+ `supabase/rollback/` file). Human applies via CLI. *(Stop-gate: approval of §5.1.)*
2. Add `scripts/generate_startmate_candidates.py` (match + payload + SQL blocks; dry-run default) with self-tests alongside the parser's.
3. Run parse → generate → review dry-run counts → apply INSERT blocks to staging (batch `startmate-2026-07`).
4. Produce the staging-review doc; Stephen reviews/updates statuses.
5. Generate + apply the approved-rows promotion SQL: (a) new AU/NZ funds, (b) fund contact enrichment, (c) new accelerators, (d) coworking orgs. One sub-batch at a time, verifying KB sync after each.
6. Create the newsletters/podcasts curated guide as a normal `content_items` draft for editorial review.
7. Run `enrich-investors` + `enrich-innovation-ecosystem` on the newly inserted rows.
8. Close out: update this doc with applied counts + `automation_runs`-style summary; file follow-up tickets (admin review UI; student-societies KB note) if wanted.
